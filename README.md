# About

This course is designed for Platzi, focusing on [advanced state management](https://platzi.com/new-home/clases/2597-react-estado/43689-nuevo-proyecto-codigos-de-seguridad/) in ReactJs. It includes a small project on handling security codes.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was initiated using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Launches the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Initiates the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
Refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

Refer to the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you're unsatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts for customization. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to use `eject` ever. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you're ready.
